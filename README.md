# Dataflow to Behavioral Model Converter

## Student Information
- **Name:** Kasra Amani
- **Student ID:** 98101171

## Description
This repository contains a Python script that facilitates the conversion of a dataflow model into a behavioral model. The script also integrates with a simulator to verify the correctness of the generated behavioral model.

### Question 7:
Given a dataflow model, the task is to write a Python script that transitions it to a behavioral model. The resulting behavioral model should then be verified using a simulator to ensure its accuracy and correctness.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the Python script.
3. Run the script using the command: `python dataflow_to_behavioral.py`
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to input your dataflow model.
5. The script will generate the corresponding behavioral model and initiate the simulator for verification.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Simulator of you choosing
